# SQL_plan-a-music-concert
Project realized as part of the Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree.

Analyzed the Chinook music store database (fictional, open-source dataset) with the scope of planning a potential music concert in the US.

I used SQLite to analyze the database and pull the following data:

• best selling music genre in the US

• in what city in the US rock music sells the most

• who are the top 10 rock music artist in the US

• who are the top 10 rock music customers in the US

These findings allowed me to identify the main concert musical genre based on customers preference, the best location within the US, the best artists for the concert lineup, and the best customers for promotional / referral activities.
